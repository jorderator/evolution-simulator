# Evolution Simulator

This is a small evolution simulation I am working on as a personal curiosity and learning project.
The end goal is to have a system that will find the optimal entity properties for the given
scenario, through a form of natural selection.

## Current Features:

The features currently present in the project include:

* Random distribution of food across the available area, and additional food appearing as time passes
* Random generation of entities across the available area, with statistics randomised within set ranges
* Individual entity stats are represented as an RGB value used to draw that entity

## Planned Features:

These are the various ideas I have planned, including features I plan to work on soon, as well as 
ideas for potential features to be fleshed out and implemented later, and anywhere in between.

* Implementing entity behaviour, including several forms of movement, death, reproduction, etc
* More entity properties, including those governing more complex behaviours to be added later
* Change amount of food and perhaps entities to suit window size, to prevent large window sizes
   causing very sparse food, and vice versa
* Add a side menu that can be hidden and showed, that allows changing of properties like entity
   stat ranges, food distribution, etc
